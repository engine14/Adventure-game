Enhancements:

1. Finding the correct coloured key in order to unlock
   the doors of UofT. There are three choices of coloured
   keys: green, orange, and white. This was implemented
   by creating a new class called 'Keys' and defining two
   methods, key_intro, which prints out the introduction
   to the scenario, as well as the find_key which is a 
   contains a while loop to ensure the user enters the 
   correct coloured key.

2. The user can save their current status in game as a 
   backup python file. This feature was implemented so
   that the user can refer back to the moves they have 
   completed, and is able to take multiple breaks while 
   playing the game.

3. Upbeat music is added. This was implemented by importing
   a class called winsound, which allowed the program to play
   a wav file. This was done to improve the user's mood of the 
   current situation.

4. A hand draw map of the UofT campus was added. This was 
   implemented by added a class called import os, which 
   opens the jpg file of the map. This was done to make the
   navigation easier.
